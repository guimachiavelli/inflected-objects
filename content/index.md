    “Inflected Objects” aims to examine how “the digital” can be approached now that it has – to quote the architect and writer Keller Easterling – "escaped the box"2 and has merged with the deep structures of our society. Departing from the fact that the digital can no longer be tackled as a separate medium or artistic genre and moving beyond the superficial Post-Internet discussion, I propose to address this subject manner by looking at three interrelated domains that have emerged as powerful forces in our digital society: abstraction, circulation and performance. Each of these domains will be addressed in a separate exhibition that investigates its impact on art objects, resulting in three exhibitions entitled “Abstraction”, “Circulation” and “Performance”. A fourth exhibition with the title “Autonomy” will conclude the project. As the final exhibition, it claims that art objects become increasingly autonomous under the influence of these inflecting forces.

    The first exhibition in the series “Inflected Objects” titled “Abstraction” analyzes the relation between the increasingly abstracted technological and economical flows that structure our lives and the material objects we produce. It investigates how abstracted, computational and economical processes leak in, mingle, underlie and structure our physical materiality.
